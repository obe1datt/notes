  System (Parent) > smss.exe (Child)
    System
    System > smss.exe
    csrss.exe
    wininit.exe
    wininit.exe > services.exe
    wininit.exe > services.exe > svchost.exe
    lsass.exe
    winlogon.exe
    explorer.exe
    
Sysinternal

    File and Disk Utilities
    Networking Utilities
    Process Utilities
    Security Utilities
    System Information
    Miscellaneous

The most used tools 
1- tcpview --> show connections
2- process exploer 
Process Explorer enables you to inspect the details of a running process, such as:
    Associated services
    Invoked network traffic
    Handles such as files or directories opened
    DLLs and memory-mapped files loaded
    
# Endpoint Logging 
1- Windwso event logs https://tryhackme.com/room/windowseventlogs 
   it is not text file can be acessed in text editor 
   raw data can trnalated in xml using windwos api 
   the files stored in binary fromat with .evt and evtx extensions  
   the evtx fromat are stored in C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs
   
   The Three ways to access these files 
   1- Event viwer (GUI)
   2- Wevtutil.exe (CMD)
   3- Get-WinEvent (PS)
   
2- Sysmon 
   tool used to monitor and log events in windows 
   used in enterprise level as part of their logining solutions
   it like evenet viwer but eith more details 
   sysmon athers high qulity and detailed logs 
   commonly used in SIEM  and other pasing soultios 
   sysmon includes 27 of Events IDs
    
    
3- osquery     
   it is open-source tool creted by facebook 
   with this tool IR teams can query endpoint or multiple endpoints using SQL syntax
   can installed on mutiple endpoints 
   to interact with osquery type osqueryi in CMD or PS 
   
   osquery>  seelect pid,name,path from  processes where name='lsass.exe';
   Kolide Fleet UI
   you can query mutiple ednpoints at asme time  

4- Wazuh 
   it is opensource EDR endpoint detection and response  tool 
   help to mintor the device for any milcios activity 
   this tool has nutiple features :  
      Auditing a device for common vulnerabilities
      Proactively monitoring a device for suspicious activity such as unauthorized logins, brute-force attacks, or privilege escalations.

      Recording a device's normal operating behaviour to help with detecting anomalies
    
    
# Evnet log analysis     
1- Event corrletation 
   identifes significant relationships from mutiple log sources like network application endpoints  
   exmaple netwroks logs have mutiples  logsources like sysmon , firewall logs , routers switches logs  
   With this information, we can connect the dots of each artefact from the two data sources:
      Source and Destination IP
      Source and Destination Port
      Action Taken
      Protocol
      Process name
      User Account
      Machine Name
   
2- Baselining     
   the process kowing that what is expected to be normal 
   with that can help us quickly determine the outliers that could threaten the organization
