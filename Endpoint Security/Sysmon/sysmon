What is sysmon 
used to mintor and log events in windows commnly used in enterprise level 
is is provides detailed information about process creation and cnetwork connections and change file creation time 
this logs send to SIEM and alnyize it 

sysmon it si the most used by with SIEM and other Log pasing solutions that anlyze and filter and visulize the events  
the sysmon run at boot time 
it events are forwared to SIEM to more anaylsis 

path in event viewr 
Events within Sysmon are stored in Applications and Services Logs/Microsoft/Windows/Sysmon/Operational

Sysmon config file 
https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config

The sysmon works by include and excluding events

Event ID 1  : Process Creation 
This will look for any process has been created you can use it to detct anu sus process
this code used detect sus process , means laert any process not svchost.exe 

<RuleGroup name="" groupRelation="or">
	<ProcessCreate onmatch="exclude">
	 	<CommandLine condition="is">C:\Windows\system32\svchost.exe -k appmodel -p -s camsvc</CommandLine>
	</ProcessCreate>
  
</RuleGroup>

Event ID 3 : Network Events 
Look for events that ocus remotly 
THis will include any sus files and sources as will open ports 
This Event use iamge and DestinationPort in XML 
<RuleGroup name="" groupRelation="or">
	<NetworkConnect onmatch="include">
	 	<Image condition="image">nmap.exe</Image>
	 	<DestinationPort name="Alert,Metasploit" condition="is">4444</DestinationPort>
	</NetworkConnect>
</RuleGroup>

The above code snippet includes two ways to identify suspicious network connection activity. The first way will identify files transmitted 
over open ports. In this case, we are specifically looking for nmap.exe which will then be reflected within the event logs. The second method
identifies open ports and specifically port 4444 which is commonly used with Metasploit. If the condition is met an event will be created and
ideally trigger an alert for the SOC to further investigate.




Event ID 7 : Image Loaded 
It is usefull to detect DLLs and detect DLL injection and hijacking attaks
it is use  Image, Signed, ImageLoaded, and Signature XML tags. 
<RuleGroup name="" groupRelation="or">
	<ImageLoad onmatch="include">
	 	<ImageLoaded condition="contains">\Temp\</ImageLoaded>
	</ImageLoad>
</RuleGroup>
THis code above detect any DLLs loaded in TMP folder 
if DLL load in tmp that may indetceda sus 


Event ID 8 : Create Remote Thread 
THis will Detect process injection code into other prcoess 
THe CreateRemoteThread is used for ligitmate task however the malwares use it to hide it si actvity 
his event will use the SourceImage, TargetImage, StartAddress, and StartFunction XML tags.
<RuleGroup name="" groupRelation="or">
	<CreateRemoteThread onmatch="include">
	 	<StartAddress name="Alert,Cobalt Strike" condition="end with">0B80</StartAddress>
	 	<SourceImage condition="contains">\</SourceImage>
	</CreateRemoteThread>
</RuleGroup>
The above code snippet shows two ways of monitoring for CreateRemoteThread. The first method will look at the memory address for a specific
ending condition which could be an indicator of a Cobalt Strike beacon. The second method will look for injected processes that do not have 
a parent process. This shouThis event uses TargetFilename XML tags
ld be considered an anomaly and require further investigation. 

Event ID 11 : File Creation 
Log events when recored when file are create or overwriten to endpoint 
<RuleGroup name="" groupRelation="or">
	<FileCreate onmatch="include">
	 	<TargetFilename name="Alert,Ransomware" condition="contains">HELP_TO_SAVE_FILES</TargetFilename>
	</FileCreate>
</RuleGroup> 
This code used to dtect ransomware 
This event uses TargetFilename XML tags

Event ID 12/13/14 : Regisitry Event 
It is lokos for any changes on the reqistry 
the malwre uses reqgsites to malware perstinace 
This event uses TargetObject XML tags.

<RuleGroup name="" groupRelation="or">
	<RegistryEvent onmatch="include">
	 	<TargetObject name="T1484" condition="contains">Windows\System\Scripts</TargetObject>
	</RegistryEvent>
</RuleGroup>
THis code above help to detect any file writes in Windows\System\Scripts" that regesirt used by adversry to place script to keep prestiance 

Event ID 15  : FileCreatStreamHash 
It is used to detect ADS alertative data stream it used to hide malware 
<RuleGroup name="" groupRelation="or">
	<FileCreateStreamHash onmatch="include">
	 	<TargetFilename condition="end with">.hta</TargetFilename>
	</FileCreateStreamHash>
</RuleGroup> 
THis code for detect .hta extension in ADS


Event ID 22 : DNS Event
Log all DNS queris 
THe best pratice it is to exclude the ligtmate  sites
This event uses QueryName XML tags
<RuleGroup name="" groupRelation="or">
	<DnsQuery onmatch="exclude">
	 	<QueryName condition="end with">.microsoft.com</QueryName>
	</DnsQuery>
</RuleGroup> 
THis code will ecclude the evnets from  micrsoft.com

re are a variety of ways and tags that you can use to customize your configuration files. We will be using the ION-Storm and
SwiftOnSecurity config files for the rest of this room however feel free to use your own configuration files
