What is  EDR (Endpoint Detection and response)
it is series of tool and application to mintor device and for any actvity that indicate threat or security breach 
this tool and application has nultple featues  
    1- auditing device for vulnablites 
    2- Proactively monotring device for sus activites 
    3- viusilze comlex data in graoh 
    4- recored device normal behavior to detect anomlize 
    
wazuh created in 2015 
created as mangment and agent module  

1-Wazuh Agents  
  the devices recored the events and processes caleed agent 
  agents monotiesd the events and process like authentication and user managment  .. 
  agnet will ofload events and ens it to wazuh 
   to deploay new aagetn go to wazuh --> agents --> click deploay new agents 
      1- chose your operating system like windows 
      2- put you ip adress or domin of wazuh server 
      3- asign agent to group 
      4- copy command you have been gived and put it into server 


2- Wazuh vulnablitey assemnet and secuirty events  
   it si powerfull module used to scan agent operating system for installed operating system and ther versions  
   once the information gathred it is send back to wazuh server  
   The vulnerability scanner module  start scan when the agent has been deploued or wazuh agent installed  
   the wazuh can test agent config based on certain rule set  to check compiance 
   to see all events Wazuh -->  modules  --> security events  --> dashboared  
   you can anlyze events by click on the event will exapnd it 
   wazuh --> agents --> security evennts (chose last hours)



3- Wazuh security auditing  
   wazuh can audit and monoiter an angetn config and recored events logs 
   audit perfrom using diffrent framewotks like PCI-DSS ,NIST  ,ISO ,MITRE ,SCA
   Wazuh --> modules --> Policy monitoring
   
4- Monotring logons iwth wazuh 
   wazuh can recored every secsuufull or insucessfull uthenrication 
   The rule with an id of 5710 detects attempted connections that are unsuccessful for the SSH protocol. 
   the alerts in wazuh on this path /var/ossec/logs/alerts/alerts.log
   you can see all rules wazuh --> managment --> Administration --> rules
   
5- Collect windows logs with wazuh 
    the information is stored in the Windows event log using a tool called Sysmon.
    we can use sysmon to aggreagte it with wazuh to process it 
    1- config sysmon to with xml rules to ensure the sysmon take the rules application->microsoft->windows-> sysmon->operitonal 
    2- config wazuh put this ossec.conf 
      <localfile>
    <location>Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational</location>
    <log_format>eventchannel</log_format>
        </localfile>
    3- restart wazuh agent  
    4- add sysmon to wazuh managment server  put this in path --> /var/ossec/etc/rules/local_rules.xml
        <group name="sysmon,">
         <rule id="255000" level="12">
        <if_group>sysmon_event1</if_group>
        <field name="sysmon.image">\\powershell.exe||\\.ps1||\\.ps2</field>
        <description>Sysmon - Event 1: Bad exe: $(sysmon.image)</description>
            <group>sysmon_event1,powershell_execution,</group>
      </rule>
      </group>
 6- collect linux events with wazuh 
    by using wazuh  log collector  service to create  entary on the agent  
    1- config zazuh log collector on linux server 
    2- wazuh come many rules that help to anlyize logs  file you can fins it here --> /var/ossec/ruleset/rules
    * wazuh magnagmetn configrationfile /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf

7- auditing commands on linux with wazuh 
   wazuh uses auditd packge to monitor certain action and events on linux based 
   we can use log collector to read the log file and send it to wazuh managment server  
   we need to install audited packge and plugin 
   1- sudo apt-get install auditd audispd-plugins
   enable the service 
    1- sudo systemctl enable auditd.service & sudo systemctl start auditd.service
   
   you can use it to mintor certain commnds  
   you can add your rules on this dir -- >/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules
   example:
   letâ€™s edit the file using sudo nano /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules and appending 
   -a exit,always -F arch=64 -F euid=0 -S execve -k audit-wazuh-c
   
   then run this commadn to informs audits for new rules 
   sudo auditctl -R /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules
   
   finally we need log gile to wazuh agent that created with auditd
   add this to sudo nano /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf 
   <localfile>
    <location>/var/log/audit/audit.log</location>
    <log_format>audit</log_format>
   </localfile>
