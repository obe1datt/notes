################################
Event Viwer  
The Event viwer are not text file so we can not view it using  text editor
THe raw data are translted to XML using windwos api 
stored in binary fromat .evt .evtx 
The .evtx are stored in  C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs

The Event Logs Elements 
It is format who the information are presented  

1- System Logs   --> assiceated with OPerating system , likr hardware , device drive changes  (info about device)

5- faliure audit --> audeited security acess is atemped fails 

To access Event Logs
1- GUI --> Event Viwer eventvwr.msc
2- CMD --> Wevtutil.exe

Event Viwer have the panes
1-The pane on the left provides a hierarchical tree listing of the event log providers.
2-The pane in the middle will display a general overview and summary of the events specific to a selected provider.
3- The pane on the right is the actions pane.

Midle Panes 
1- Level --> type of the log 
2- Date and Time
3- Source --> the name of the software case the event 
4- ID --> uniqe ID numric vlaue of maped for an operation
5- Task Catagory --> help to orgnixe the entry so you can use the filters 

when click on event pop up will show up 
hace to sections  
1- General 
2- Details 

The Action Panle 
Create Coustem View and Filter current logs are smae but has one diffrent filter are for oe spicifc action 
You can view logs fro another computer by right-click on Event Veiwer (Local)
################################################################3
wevtutil.exe cmd event veiwer 
Allow you to retrive infromation about logs and publishers  
and install and unistall event mainfets  and run queris and export archive clear logs 

to show help  wevtutil.exe /?
and for spicific utility 
 wevtutil.exe ep /?
 
 how many logs --> wevtutil.exe el | Measure-Object
 
wevtutil qe Application /c:3 /rd:true /f:text
 log name >> Application

 /rd Event read direction
 /c Maximum number of events to read

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.diagnostics/Get-WinEvent?view=powershell-7.3&viewFallbackFrom=powershell-7.1
Get-WinEvent 
it is like wevtutil.exe

get all logs from computer 
Get-WinEvent -Listlog  *

Get log event provider 
Get-WinEvent -ListProvider *

Log filtering 
 Get-WinEvent -LogName Application | Where-Object { $_.ProviderName -Match 'WLMS' }


###############################################################33
Xpath query 
we filter events as xpath 
it is proivide  standared syntax and symentic for addressing  prts of XML documetn and  manipulating strings, numbers, and booleans

example 
XPath Query: *[System[(Level <= 3) and TimeCreated[timediff(@SystemTime) <= 86400000]]]
all events from the channel or log file where the severity level is less than or equal to
3 and the event occurred in the last 24 hour period

Event Viwer help us to construct xpath query 
By click on Detials button
THe first tag it is the starting point it is * or Event Word 
THe command will loo like 
Get-WinEvent -LogName Application -FilterXPath '*'
Now we work our way down the XML tree. The next tag is System.
Get-WinEvent -LogName Application -FilterXpath "*/System"

Xpath it is like tree 
let add event id 

Get-WinEvent -LogName Application -FilterXpath "*/System/EventID=100"

using wevtutil.exe 
wevtutil.exe qe Application /q:*/System[EventID=100] /f:text /c:1

Filter on provider name  
Get-WinEvent -LogName Application -FilterXPath '*/System/Provider[@Name="WLMS"]'

using wevtutil 
Get-WinEvent -LogName Application -FilterXPath '*/System/Provider[@Name="WLMS"]'



combine tow queries 
Get-WinEvent -LogName Application -FilterXPath '*/System/EventID=101 and */System/Provider[@Name="WLMS"]'

Create Xpath query for EventData Elemnt
Get-WinEvent -LogName Security -FilterXPath '*/EventData/Data[@Name="TargetUserName"]="System"' -MaxEvent 1


query to find WLMS events with a System Time of 2020-12-15T01:09:08.940277500Z
Get-WinEvent -LogName Application -FilterXPath '*/System/Provider[@Name="WLMS"] and */System/TimeCreated[@Name="SystemTime"]="2020-12-15T01:09:08.940277500Z"'

 query to find a user named Sam with an Logon Event ID of 4720
 Get-WinEvent -LogName Security -FilterXPath '*/EventData/Data[@Name="TargetUserName"]="Sam" and */System/EventID=4720'
 
 Sam as the user, what time was Event ID 4724 recorded
 Get-WinEvent -LogName Security -FilterXPath '*/EventData/Data[@Name="TargetUserName"]="Sam" and */System/EventID=4724'

Note: Some events will not be generated by default, and certain features will need to be enabled/configured on the endpoint, 
such as PowerShell logging. This feature can be enabled via Group Policy or the Registry.
Local Computer Policy > Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows PowerShell


Some resources to provide more information about enabling this feature, along with its associated event IDs:

Another feature to enable/configure is Audit Process Creation, which will generate event ID 4688. 
This will allow command-line process auditing. This setting is NOT enabled in the virtual machine
but feel free to enable it and observe the events generated after executing some commands.
