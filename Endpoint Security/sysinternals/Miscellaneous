 Real-world scenario: As a security engineer, I had to work with vendors to troubleshoot why an agent wasn't responding on an endpointâ€”the tools used were ProcExp, ProcMon, and ProcDump.

    ProcExp = to inspect the agent process, its properties, and associated threads and handles.
    ProcMon = to investigate if there were any indicators on why the agent was not operating as it should.
    ProcDump = to create a dump of the agent process to send to the vendor for further analysis.

And guess what? Asking questions about Sysinternals became part of the interview questions when hiring additional staff.

Remember, red teamers and adversaries even use these tools.

Below are some additional links to further your knowledge on how to use these tools as a Security Analyst, Security Engineer, or even an Incident Responder:
