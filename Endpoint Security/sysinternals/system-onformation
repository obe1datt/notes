Tool Number 1  
WinObj
"WinObj is a 32-bit Windows NT program that uses the native Windows NT API (provided by NTDLL.DLL) to access and display information on the NT Object Manager's name space." (official definition)

To showcase this tool, let's look into the concept of Session 0 and Session 1 that was mentioned in the Core Windows Processes room.

Remember that Session 0 is the OS session and Session 1 is the User session. Also recall that there will be at least 2 csrss.exe processes running, one for each session. Note Session 1 will be for the first user logged into the system.
