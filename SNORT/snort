#This snort notes 

Snort : open source network intrusion detection (IDS) and prevention system (IPS) based on rules means signature based IDS and IPS

What is IDS -->  IDS id passive monitor for detection bad traffic and give alert ofr admin  
types:
     NIDS --> installed on network (network IDS)
     HIDS --> on computers or hots (Host IDS)
  
What is IPS -->  IPS is protecting solution to protect the network agnist attacks 
types: 
     NIPS -->  installed on network (signature based )
     NBA  -->  installed on network (behavior based) use machine learning  or baselining to learn normal traffic 
     WIPS -->  for wireless networks 
     HIPS -->  for computers or any client

Detection/Prevention Techniques:
         1- Signature based -->  based on rules 
         2- behavior or anomaly based  --> using machine learnign or AI
         2- Policy based --> based on system security policy 
 
 
 Start with snort 
 
 $ snort -V  --> snort version  
 $ sudo snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -T -->  -c spicify condif file -T testing the config file 
 $ snort -q --> dont show banner 
 
 snort sniffing mode :
 -v  -->  -verbose show all tcp/ip output 
 -d  -->  print packet data
 -e  --> print headers details 
 -x  --> print data of packet  in hex      
 -i  --> interface use it for sniff 
 
 snort packet loging mode:
 -l --> lgging mode save output to dir  
 -K --> log in ASCII also creatres dir for human format 
 -r --> read snort log file  
 -n --> number of packet to process after n will stop 
 Examples :
 $ sudo snort -dev  -l .
 $ snort -dev -K ASCII -l .
 $ snort -r <snort logfile to read > --> also you can read the file in tcpdump and wireshark 
 $ snort -der <logfile> -n 10  --> process only 10 packets 
 filtering in snort 
 
 $ snort -r <logfile> -X
 $ snort -r <logfile>  icmp
 $ snort -r <lofile>  tcp
 $ snort -r <logfile> 'udp and port 53'
 
Snort IDS/IPS mode 

-N --> Disbale logging 
-D --> run in background
-A --> alert mode 
       full --> full alert mode all possible info about the alert (the defult when but -A)
       fast --> fast info about alert like alert msg timestamp source ip  and port number 
       console --> fast style alert on screen 
       cmg --> basic header details and payload hex and text format 
       none --> no alert display 
       
rule in snort --> alert icmp any any <> any any(msg:"icmp packet found"; sid: 100001; rev:1;)

this path were you can add your rule --> "/etc/snort/rules/local.rules"

$ sudo snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -N --> disbale logging
$ sudo snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -D --> in background

$ ps -ef | grep snort 
$ sudo kill -9 <process id>
