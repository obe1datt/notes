Elastic it collection on many component that are linked togother that help user to collect data from diffrent source in diffrent format  
and perfrom search anlyize and  visualize the data in real-time.

the Elastic component 
   1- Elastic search 
   2- Logstash
   3- Beats 
   4- Kibana 
  
  
  Elastic search 
  it is full text search and  analytics engine yused to store json format  
  it used to store analize and perform correlation on the data 
  Ealstic support REST API to inegrate with data
  
  
  Logstash 
  it is processing engine  used to tkae data from diffrent sources and apply filters on it and send it to destination wich it kibana or ports
  the logstash has config file divded into three parts  
  1- Input part  --> defines the source which the data being ingested 
      it is suppor diffrent pulgins  https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/8.1/input-plugins.html
  2- filter part 
     which it is spicfies the filter options to normilze the log ingested above
     it is support many filters https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/8.1/filter-plugins.html
  3- Output --> where the user wants to send filtred data  listening port, Kibana Interface, elasticsearch database, a file
     it is support many pulgins https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/8.1/output-plugins.html
     
  
  
  Beats 
  it is used to ship/transfer data from endpoint to elastic search 
  
  
  Kibana 
  Kibana is a web-based data visualization that works with elasticsearch to analyze, investigate and visualize the data stream 
  in real-time. It allows the users to create multiple visualizations and dashboards for better visibilityâ€”more on Kibana in the 
  following tasks
  
  work flow
  Beats (collect from agents) --> logstash(input/filter/process/output) --> elasticsearch(store and indexing) --> kibana(anlyze and visulaixe)
  
  
     Beats is a set of different data shipping agents used to collect data from multiple agents. Like Winlogbeat is used to
     collect windows event logs, Packetbeat collects network traffic flows.
    Logstash collects data from beats, ports or files, etc., parses/normalizes it into field value pairs, and stores them into elasticsearch.
    Elasticsearch acts as a database used to search and analyze the data.
    Kibana is responsible for displaying and visualizing the data stored in elasticsearch. The data stored in elasticseach can easily be
    shaped into different visualizations, time charts, infographics, etc., using Kibana.
